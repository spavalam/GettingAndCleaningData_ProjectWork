### First it reads all the relevant data files from sub folders "test" and "train" in current working directory and also the input files present in current working directory.

### Merges all the read relevant data into one dataset

### Name the measurement columns after the feature names, and give names to the id columns

### Create a new data frame whose measurement columns contain only Mean and Standard Deviation features

### Trim the rows to the 180 needed to show mean values for each subject-activity pair

### Rename stuff and output the data to "Output_Tidy_Samsung_Data.txt"
